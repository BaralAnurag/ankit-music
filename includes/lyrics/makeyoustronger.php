                Sleep baby Sleep, you've done enough for everyone<br>
                Hold me tight, I'll show you the light that's burning slow<br>
                Close your eyes, you need some rest tonight<br>
                Hear this melody, it's gonna help you to sleep<br>
                <br>
                Its raining outside<br>
                Rainbow colors on the sky, tonight<br>
                Its a beautiful day<br>
                And so will be the night<br>
                I'll sing you the lullaby<br>
                <br>
                Wet clothes, watery eyes<br>
                Don't cry, you'll be alright<br>
                Scarlet scars on your skin<br>
                broken bones I know they will heal<br>
                <br>
                Its raining outside<br>
                Rainbow colors on the sky, tonight<br>
                Its a beautiful day<br>
                And so will be the night<br>
                I'll sing you the lullaby<br>
                <br>
                And I'll sing you the lullaby<br>
                It'll soothe your pain<br>
                I'm gonna make you stronger again<br>
                till you can fight their lies<br>
