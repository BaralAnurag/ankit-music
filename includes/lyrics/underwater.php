                Underwater,<br>
                I look for the answers I never seem to find<br>
                And you're the ocean,<br>
                I am just another man dying inside<br>
                <br>
                These waters they whisper but I cannot understand<br>
                Maybe a word from you will help me figure this out<br>
                <br>
                Underwater,<br>
                There's a place where we can hide forever<br>
                Take my hand and I'll show you the way<br>
                but tell me you'll never return<br>
                <br>
                These waters they whisper but I cannot understand<br>
                Maybe a word from you will help me figure this out.<br>
                We can dance together underwater<br>
                And you and I can sing sweet melodies we know<br>
                <br>
                Down underwater<br>
                <br>
                But this day will come for sure<br>
                when you'll have to let me go<br>
                I won't be far away from you<br>
                I'll be down here underwater.<br>
