                We've all been down this road,<br>
                Been there before<br>
                They create you, they erase you<br>
                The memories inside of you,<br>
                They're split in two<br>
                But don't you do what you're told to, anymore.<br>
                <br>
                I hate this feeling again and again,<br>
                I try to control it, I can't control it<br>
                I wish I could<br>
                You know that I know, that I know<br>
                We are tomorrow, we're not here to follow<br>
                What leads to the end.<br>
                <br>
                I cannot feel this atmosphere,<br>
                I am trapped in here, so let me out<br>
                You can now take me to September<br>
                And you'll remember us somehow<br>
                This path will lead me to nowhere<br>
                I am falling, I am falling down<br>
                Lord you gotta take me to a better place.<br>
                <br>
                We all been down that road,<br>
                Been there before<br>
                They create you, they erase you<br>
                The memories inside of you,<br>
                They're split in two<br>
                But don't you do what you're told to, anymore.<br>
