                Meet,<br>
                Before the sunrise<br>
                We'll leave,<br>
                Before the dawn<br>
                Sleep,<br>
                As long as you want my dear<br>
                Cause tomorrow,<br>
                We will be long gone<br>
                <br>
                Hear,<br>
                The sound of silence<br>
                The Shadow,<br>
                Of the birds in the ocean<br>
                I'll take you, to that place where,<br>
                Where we have never been before<br>
                Cause tomorrow we will be long gone<br>
                <br>
                And I'll be with you<br>
                <br>
                We'll be gone far away<br>
                Like the birds, we'll fly away<br>
                We will leave, we'll leave this place<br>
                And never come back again.<br>
